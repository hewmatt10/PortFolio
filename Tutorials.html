<h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
<p>
Object Oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming
model/idea based off of the idea of objects. The main idea of
object oriented programming is to use classes as datatypes in
order to achieve tasks that procedural programming cannot, or
simplify them. This is because of structures, or objects, that
store data, which greatly reduces the amount of code written and
associates variables with similar attributes together. OOP allows
for different programming problems to be broken down into smaller
problems. Drawing this diagram of decomposition results in a tree.
OOP allows for the ease of creating and modifying objects and
methods with ease and focuses on the data rather than the
procedure. Lastly, a key feature and concept in OOP is
encapsulation, which is the idea of hiding/private variables to
prevent accidental modification to variables when unecessary. 
</p>
<p>
Once again, it is clear that this is a class that has certain attributes. In order to use this class, one must create an instance of the 
class and then add data to it. The idea of OOP is to use many of these classes, such as the one above, that do different tasks
to get the program to work. OOP is often used in large frameworks to organize data. As an example, an ATM machine could be a class, where
the user can choose different button to do different tasks. The button is then considered an interface, or an affliction of attributes that 
are common amongst different classes. Each button can be a new class, representing a different set of attributes that differentiate them.
The fundamental idea of OOP is using classes, and for classes, one needs a constructor, something that allows for one to create an instance variable of the class.


</p>
<p>
The first key concept in OOP is encapsulation, or the idea of hiding variables so only methods within a class can access the variable.
This extends to hiding methods so only variables declared as the class' type can access and use the methods. Encapsulation prevents the 
overwriting of data and keeps what is being done organize and well built. Without encapsulation, data would be freefloating in the program
and that is disorganized and often times, very hard to manage/code.
</p>
<p>
Another key idea in OOP is inheritance. It is when a subclass can be a superclass. In other words, it is when one moves down a tree of
relationships, where each of a node's children is a type of the parent but not necessarily vice versa. This is where encapsulation becomes important
as parent classes cannot access all methods of the children class unless initialized as one.
</p>
<p>
Abstract classes are classes that have specific attributes and functions. One cannot declare a variable of an abstract data type. However,
through inheritance, a subclass can be extending an abstract class, which can then be a variable. Abstract classes allows the affliction 
between closely related classes and can form relationships, being able to use classes of the abstract class. There is also interfaces, essentially
for relationships for objects that do similar tasks but cannot have similar variables. However, the idea is the same as abstract classes.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, polymorphism is the idea of different classes inheriting abstract or interfaces. As an insight, a dog can be an abstract class,
with fur, teeth, can bark, can eat, etc. However, differernt breeds of dogs have different attributes afflicted with them and are thus different classes.
Polymorphism uses this idea of different classes having similar attributes being connected by a superclass that is an abstract class or interface.

<h2>Arrays</h2>
<p>
What are arrays? One can think of arrays as a set of values of a
datatype. These values are then ordered starting from 0. However,
the set is not infinite. In fact, before using the array, one must
declare the array, which is telling the computer it exists. After
that, to use the array, one must initialize it. This means they
must allocate a part of the memory to the array. Then, when using
the array, one assigns a value to each index of the array,
starting at 0. This is the ordering of the array mentioned above.
One can only assign values of the declared datatype into the
array, and you cannot exceed the initialized size, because the
computer has only given the initialized space to the array, and
you cannot just allocate another space spontaenously. We can view the 
syntax of arrays and declaration of the arrays on the left. We can clearly
see that to access an element in an array we use [] and to initialize it,
we create it like we are creating a class basically.

<h2>ArrayLists</h2>
<p>
When seeing the name ArrayList, one can instantly tell the
components of the word; array and list. This word is exactly what
it means. It is a list that acts similar to an array. How is it
similar? Well, first of all, they are both indexed, and one can
access both of them using the index to access that element in the
ArrayList. However, the fundamental differences are also clear.
Firstly, an ArrayList is a class, and thus its contents are not
directly accessed and modified, but rather it is through methods.
Next, an ArrayList is dynamic, what this means is that, unlike an
array, one is able to constantly append elements to it (until
overflow) because it does not have a static memory allocation.
While this is convenient, ArrayLists are memory-consuming and are
very slow because of constant allocation and indirect access to
the memory.

<h2>Searching</h2>
<p>
What is searching? In english, it means the process of finding
something. In programming, it means the exact same thing, except
one would actually know how to find it. Searching in programming,
in short, is to find a value in an associated set of values. The
search range for this value could be a set, an ArrayList, an
array, or even an array of ArrayLists, it is merely a term for
saying "finding an element in a bunch of elements". A simple
sorting technique is to simply traverse through all the elements.
By the pigeonhole principle or trivial intuition, if you pass
through the all the elements, and your target was not found, then
the target is not found in the set, and trivially, the opposite
holds true. Another searching algorithm is binary search. This
requires one to have a sorted set before beginning the search.
Firstly, one picks the midpoint of the two endpoints of the set.
If the target is smaller than element at midpoint, repeat the
operation on the half with smaller elements, otherwise, do it on
the one with larger elements. Repeat this until the right and left
overlap or pass each other. If none of the midpoints is equal to
the target, one knows that it is not in the set.

<h2>Sorting</h2>
<p>
What is sorting? It is simply ordering elements in a specific
pattern, often by value or alphabetical order. There are many
sorting algorithms, but the idea is to simply order a set of
elements in a certain way. As the comparison between elements is
just a single operation, we can assume withouth loss of generality
that we are sorting from least to greatest. There are many sort
algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort. I
will be focusing on insertion sort and merge sort. Merge sort uses
the idea of breaking down into halves and then reformation. For an
array, break it down into left and right arrays, and keep on doing
that for those arrays, until your array only consists of one
element, then we start reformation, for each two subarrays, we
merge them together by performing two pointers on them, which is
basically to say we compare one element in one array with one in
the other, as each of them are sorted, we simply iterate through
checking each element and seeing which is smaller and pushing that
one. When done, you have another sorted subarray that you can push
up to do mergesort again. Repeat this until your entire array is
sorted. This sorting algorithm takes NlogN time meaning
theoretically it is faster than insertion sort, but with smaller
datatypes, the randomness in them are enlarged, so the complexity
of insertion sort may be as fast as linear time, while mergesort
has a static time complexity.

<h2>Final Project</h2>
<p>
Our final project is called Covid Dilemma and is a COVID-19 game
that stimulates the pandemic that is happening right now. Our game
allows for the user to make choices based off of intuition and
their answer directly impacts how well they are doing
financial-wise and health-wise. The use can choose two different
gamemodes, they may play as Prime Minister or civilian. They will
be in charge of different decisions depending on which game mode
they choose and will have to be responsible for a different set
and scale of people. The president also has a unique bird-eye view
of the statistics on COVID-19 such as the infected numbers,
percentage dead, etc. Overall, this is a great choose-your-path
game that is perfect for intelligent gamers to play during
quarantine.
